Graviton Browser
################

This is the design document site for a *proposed* project called Graviton. This project is not fully implemented at
the current time, and this site is intended to act as a rallying point for people interested in helping create it.

Graviton Browser is a browser-like shell for apps that run on the JVM and use GUI toolkits for their user interfaces,
rather than HTML. Graviton also supports command line apps, allowing developers to distribute platform independent
command line apps via an interface that works the same way on Windows, Mac and Linux.
