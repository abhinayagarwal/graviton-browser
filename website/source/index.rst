Graviton Browser
################

This is the design document site for a *proposed* project called Graviton Browser. This browser is not implemented at
the current time, and this site is intended to act as a rallying point for people interested in helping create it.

Graviton Browser is a browser-like shell for apps that run on the JVM and use GUI toolkits for their user interfaces,
rather than HTML.
